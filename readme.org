* About
This is a skeletal version of ~f2py~. Essentially it is stripped out of ~numpy~.

#+begin_quote
It is *not meant to be used*.

** Why?
The only reason this exists is because the development cycle can be a bit slow
when it involves compiling ~numpy~ each time. That being said, patches and files
from this repository should be essentially interoperable with the ~numpy~ repo
after adjusting for file paths.
